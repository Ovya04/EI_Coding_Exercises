# Chain of Responsibility Pattern - Support Ticket System

## Overview
The Chain of Responsibility pattern passes requests along a chain of handlers until one handles the request.

## Use Case
This example demonstrates a support ticket system where tickets are escalated through different support levels based on priority.

## Key Components
- **SupportHandler**: Abstract handler class
- **SupportTicket**: Request object with priority levels
- **Level1Support, Level2Support, Level3Support**: Concrete handlers
- **Main**: Demonstrates the chain processing

## Benefits
- Decouples sender and receiver
- Allows runtime chain modification
- Follows Single Responsibility Principle
- Enables flexible request handling
