Behavioural patterns focus on communication between objects and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

## Patterns Implemented

### 1. Chain of Responsibility Pattern
**Location**: `chain_of_responsibility/`

**Location**: `observer/`
**Use Case**: Weather station with multiple displays
**Purpose**: Notifies multiple objects about state changes

## Key Benefits of Behavioural Patterns
- Define how objects interact and communicate
- Distribute responsibilities among objects
