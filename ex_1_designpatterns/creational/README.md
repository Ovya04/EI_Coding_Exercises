# Creational Design Patterns 

 Object instantiation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reusability in object creation while hiding creation complexity from client code.

## Overview

Creational patterns solve the fundamental software engineering challenge of object instantiation by providing controlled, flexible mechanisms for creating objects without specifying exact classes or creation logic.

## Implemented Patterns

### 1. Builder Pattern üìã
**Location**: `builder/`  
**Problem Solved**: Complex object construction with multiple optional parameters  
**Business Context**: Pizza ordering system requiring step-by-step customization  
**Technical Implementation**: Fluent interface with method chaining for incremental object assembly

**Use Case Demonstration**: "A pizza restaurant system where customers build custom pizzas by selecting size and progressively adding optional toppings through an intuitive step-by-step interface."

**Key Technical Features**:
- Fluent API design with method chaining
- Immutable final product with private constructor
- Separation of object construction from representation
- Prevention of inconsistent object states during construction

### 2. Factory Pattern üè≠
**Location**: `factory/`  
**Problem Solved**: Object creation abstraction and type-specific instantiation  
**Business Context**: Vehicle rental system supporting multiple transportation types  
**Technical Implementation**: Static factory method with polymorphic return types

**Use Case Demonstration**: "A vehicle rental service where customers specify vehicle type (car, motorcycle, bicycle) and the factory creates appropriate vehicle instances with type-specific behaviors and properties."

**Key Technical Features**:
- Polymorphic object creation through common interface
- Centralized instantiation logic with single responsibility
- Easy extensibility for new vehicle types
- Client isolation from concrete class dependencies
