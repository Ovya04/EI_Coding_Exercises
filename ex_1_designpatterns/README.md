# Design Patterns Implementation Exercise

**Project Overview**: A comprehensive demonstration of 6 fundamental design patterns implemented in Java, showcasing object-oriented design principles and software engineering best practices through interactive, real-world use cases.

## Pattern Implementations Summary

| Category | Pattern | Use Case | Technical Focus |
|----------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| **Creational** | Builder | Pizza customization system | Complex object construction with optional parameters |
| **Creational** | Factory | Vehicle rental system | Object instantiation abstraction and type management |
| **Structural** | Bridge | Media player device system | Separating abstraction from implementation |
| **Structural** | Decorator | Coffee ingredient system | Runtime behavior modification and composition |
| **Behavioural** | Chain of Responsibility | Support ticket escalation | Request processing delegation and loose coupling |
| **Behavioural** | Observer | Weather monitoring system | Event notification and publish-subscribe architecture |

### Pattern Selection Rationale
- **Builder**: Demonstrates complex object creation without telescoping constructors
- **Factory**: Shows abstraction of object instantiation and easy extensibility
- **Bridge**: Illustrates separation of concerns and implementation flexibility
- **Decorator**: Exemplifies dynamic feature addition following Open/Closed Principle
- **Chain of Responsibility**: Shows request handling delegation and loose coupling
- **Observer**: Demonstrates event-driven architecture and automatic state synchronization


#### Each folder contains it's own readme file consisting of detailed explanation about implementation and effective usage of design principles.
