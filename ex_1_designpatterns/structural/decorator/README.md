# Decorator Pattern - Coffee Shop

## Overview
The Decorator pattern allows behavior to be added to objects dynamically without altering their structure.

## Use Case

## Key Components
- **Coffee**: Base interface for coffee objects
- **BasicCoffee**: Concrete implementation of basic coffee
- **CoffeeDecorator**: Abstract decorator class
- **MilkDecorator, SugarDecorator, WhipDecorator, Vanilla Decorator**: Concrete decorators
