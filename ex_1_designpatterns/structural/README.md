# Structural Design Patterns

Structural patterns deal with object composition and typically identify simple ways to realize relationships between different objects.

## Patterns Implemented

### 1. Bridge Pattern
**Location**: `bridge/`
**Use Case**: Media player with different audio devices
**Purpose**: Separates abstraction from implementation

### 2. Decorator Pattern
**Location**: `decorator/`
**Use Case**: Coffee shop with customizable ingredients
**Purpose**: Adds behavior to objects dynamically

## Key Benefits of Structural Patterns
- Compose objects into larger structures
- Keep functionality flexible and reusable
- Ensure that changes to one part don't affect others
- Provide different ways to use object interfaces
