# Structural Design Patterns

**Technical Focus**: Object composition mechanisms that form larger structures while keeping interfaces simple and maintaining flexibility in system architecture.

## Overview

Structural patterns address the fundamental challenge of combining objects and classes into larger, more complex structures while ensuring these compositions remain flexible, maintainable, and efficient.

## Implemented Patterns

### 1. Bridge Pattern ðŸŒ‰  
**Location**: `bridge/`  
**Problem Solved**: Decoupling abstraction from implementation to allow independent variation  
**Business Context**: Media player system supporting multiple content types and output devices  
**Technical Implementation**: Composition-based design separating player logic from device-specific output

**Use Case Demonstration**: "A media streaming application where different player types (music, podcast) can operate with any audio output device (speakers, headphones), allowing all combinations to work seamlessly through a unified interface."

**Key Technical Features**:
- Composition over inheritance for flexibility
- Abstract player interface with concrete implementations
- Device abstraction enabling runtime implementation switching
- Independent evolution of abstraction and implementation hierarchies



### 2. Decorator Pattern ðŸŽ¨
**Location**: `decorator/`  
**Problem Solved**: Adding behavior to objects dynamically without altering structure  
**Business Context**: Coffee shop customization system with multiple optional add-ons  
**Technical Implementation**: Wrapper-based composition allowing recursive feature enhancement

**Use Case Demonstration**: "A coffee ordering system where customers start with basic coffee and dynamically add ingredients (milk, sugar, whipped cream) with each addition wrapping the previous object and modifying both description and pricing."

**Key Technical Features**:
- Recursive object wrapping maintaining interface consistency
- Runtime behavior modification without inheritance explosion
- Transparent decoration preserving original object interface
- Composable feature addition with order independence
